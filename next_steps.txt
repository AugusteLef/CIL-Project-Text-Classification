- Adapter (multi-language embedding)

- Dictionary of the wrongly classified tweets (extend)

- Study the differences of wrongly classified tweets between != models

- Clean code (merge main preprocessing etc?)

- Try a submission with ensemble voting with the 3/4 models

- Fix some layers and train/fine-tune the first and last layers (test how many)

- Try GLOVE model
